 \item \textbf{Hardware Accelerator for GF2 Matrix Multiplication }
	Matrix Multiplication being a primitive in applications like cryptography are of prime importance in High Performance Computing. 
	The dark silicon era of VLSI brings in a lot of bottlenecks for software only approaches of matrix multiplication. Hence power efficient
	FPGA based hardware accelerators become an important choice for the cause. The project is to study about different FPGA based cosystems to implement
	an efficient matrix multiplication in GF(2). 
	

 \textbf{\textit{Completed Work:}} 
   32 bit and 64 bit GF2 Matrix Multiplication has been implemented using SIRC(Software Interface for Reconfigurable Computing), a Microsoft based Interface framework
   for hardware-software cosystem, and the results have been compared against the existing software library M4RI.

	The Infrared tracking system developed is used for tracking slowly moving objects. An IR transmitter mounted on top of the 
	object to be tracked would transmit the signals in all possible directions. Two receivers , each mounted on top of stepper motors
	would rotate, one in the clockwise and the other in the anti-clockwise direction. Once the object is tracked the angle swept by
	the receivers would help trilaterate the exact location of the object, and would display the approximate location  on a LED matrix

 \begin{itemize}
  \setlength{\itemsep}{1pt}

  \item \textbf{{Implementation of MIPS Architecture}} \textit{(Course: System Design)}\\
	Single cycle implementation of MIPS architecture using 32 bit datapath and Multicycle implementation using 8 bit datapath were designed.
	Seventeen 32 bit wide instructions were implemented including R-type,I-type and J-type instructions.

  \item \textbf{{Design \& Simulation of 8-bit R-2R DAC}}   \textit{(Course: Mixed Signal VLSI Design)}\\
	An 8-bit R-2R DAC was designed in UMC 180nm CMOS technology achieving the worst case absolute value of DNL/INL less than
	$\frac{1}{2}$LSB for given mismatch and variation. Simulation of DNL/INL was carried out for different input codes using Cadence-Virtuoso.

  \item \textbf{{Design and write synthesizable descriptions of Data processor for 8085 in VHDL}}\\ \textit{(Course: VLSI Design Lab)}\\
	The data processor  implements ALU and performs  all data movement and ALU operations.
	This includes PUSH and POP operations involving the stack processor. The design was coded in
	VHDL and synthesized successfully.
  \item \textbf{{Design and write synthesizable descriptions of Instruction processor for 8085 in Verilog}}\\ \textit{(Course: VLSI Design Lab)}\\
	his is an FSM which fetches the next instruction from an address given by the contents of the 16 bit register ‘PC’, 
	and stores it in the instruction register. This circuit will also execute all instructions which update ‘PC’.
	The design was coded in verilog and synthesized successfully.


  \item \textbf{{Design \& Layout of an 3-8 decoder}}   \textit{(Course: Digital VLSI Design)}\\
	A 3-8 decoder with defined total electrical effort was designed in NGSPICE using CMOS logic. Design included forks with
	best possible combinations of inverters to achieve equal delay. Decoder was laid out in Magic and post layout
	simulation results were compared with calculations.

  \item \textbf{{Design of Delay Locked Loop}} \textit{(Course: Microelectronics Simulation Lab)}\\
	A DLL was designed for multiphase clock generation in NGSPICE. A charge pump charges or discharges a capacitor based
	upon phase difference detected by a phase detector. The self-adjusting control voltage on capacitor was given to the delay lines,
	using which 4 clocks were generated each with phase difference of 90\textdegree.
